*   **Safety**: MCP (Model Context Protocol) Implementation
*   **Build Tool**: Vite + Esbuild Optimized

## 🧠 MCP & Privacy

Alto is designed with privacy and safety at its core.
- **Local Context**: All indexing and context data stays at `~/.alto/context.json`.
- **Safety Gate**: Alto uses a dedicated file indexer that blocks deletion of system-critical folders (`/System`, `C:\Windows`, etc.) and user data (`Documents`, `Desktop`).
- **Offline AI**: Supports WebLLM for entirely local inference — your data never leaves your machine.
