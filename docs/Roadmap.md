# Project Roadmap 🗺️

This document outlines the planned trajectory for **Alto**. **Vision:** Alto is the **AI-based pro cleaner** — feature parity with leading system cleaners, with an AI that explains, suggests, and automates cleanup safely. Our goal is to evolve into a fully autonomous, AI-driven device maintenance suite.

---

## ✅ v1.x - Foundations (Completed)
- [x] High-performance Rust backend (Tauri).
- [x] Basic cleaning modules: System Junk, Logs, Cache.
- [x] App Uninstaller with leftover scanning.
- [x] Large Files & Malware heuristics.

## ✅ v2.x - Agentic Revolution (In Progress)
- [x] **2.0.0**: Introduction of the Premium AI Assistant (Agentic Chat).
- [x] **2.1.0**: **MCP Safety Layer** & Real-time Task Reporting.
- [x] **2.1.0**: Live System Monitoring (Background Watcher).
- [x] **2.2.0**: Space Lens with depth control, multiple roots (Home, Applications, Library), and one-click cleanup.

## 🔜 v3.0 - The Autonomous Suite (Mid 2026)
- [ ] **Self-Healing Features**: Auto-detecting performance regressions and fixing them in the background.
- [ ] **Network Optimizer**: Agentic analysis of network bottlenecks and DNS health.
- [ ] **Privacy Guard**: Detection of trackers and browser cleanup recommendations.

## 🚀 Long-Term Vision (2027+)
- **Cloud-Sync Context**: Securely sync your cleaning preferences across multiple devices.
- **Enterprise Fleet Management**: Deploy Alto across an entire office of Macs/PCs with central health reporting.
- **Predictive Maintenance**: AI models that predict hardware failure (Disk/Battery) based on system telemetry.
