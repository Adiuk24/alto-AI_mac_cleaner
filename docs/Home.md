# Welcome to the Alto Wiki 🔭

Welcome to the official documentation and knowledge base for **Alto**, the AI-powered system cleaner and optimizer for macOS and Windows.

Alto is more than just a cleaning tool; it is an **Agentic System Utility** that leverages AI to understand, monitor, and maintain your device's health.

## 📚 Table of Contents

1.  **[Roadmap](Roadmap.md)**: Explore our vision for the future of Alto.
2.  **[Architecture](Architecture.md)**: Deep dive into the Agentic Flow and MCP Safety Layer.
3.  **[User Guide](User-Guide.md)**: Learn how to get the most out of Alto's features.
4.  **[Developer Guide](../README.md#for-developers)**: Setup instructions and contribution guidelines.

## 🚀 Vision
Our goal is to build the world's first **fully autonomous system maintainer**. An app that doesn't just wait for you to click "Scan," but proactively keeps your disk clean, your system fast, and your data safe while you work.

## 🛠️ Core Concepts

### 🤖 Agentic Intelligence
Unlike traditional cleaners that use static scripts, Alto uses an LLM-driven "Agentic" backend. It analyzes your system state and makes decisions based on context, reducing false positives and identifying junk that static tools miss.

### 🛡️ MCP (Model Context Protocol)
All AI actions are gated by the Model Context Protocol. This ensures that the AI only operates within safe, pre-defined boundaries and always provides a transparent indexing of its intended actions.

### 💻 Cross-Platform Unity
Alto is built from the ground up to provide a premium, native experience on both macOS and Windows, sharing a robust Rust core for maximum performance.
